# DiffingResults

Project was made for finding the differences, if any, in two JSON containing base64 encoded binary data through API. 
Also, for unequal JSONs there is no difference finding, only returns that their sizes do not match.
--Dictionary was used for storage of Json files because it was not needed
--Testing was done with Postman
--base64 was converted to array for the purpose of comparing
--JSON serialization and deserialization rules are in Startup.cs
Enjoy :)
